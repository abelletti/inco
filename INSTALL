The build process is very primitive at the moment.

Currently you must be using Solaris or a Solaris derivative of some sort.
Build with:

CC=gcc make

Also available:

make clean

If you haven't got a Solaris box handy, I've found the easiest way to test
is via the Vagrant box "omniti/omnios-r151008".  For some of my testing, I
upgraded to the r151010 release via the instructions at
http://omnios.omniti.com/wiki.php/Upgrade_r151008_r151010.  This may be
necessary in order to install the "mbuffer" package and is certainly
needed if you require the "netcat" package.
