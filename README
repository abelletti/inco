This is the "inco" fast stream compress/decompression tool.

It uses (currently) the LZJB algorithm that's built into ZFS.  It's not
very powerful, but it is very quick.  Perfect for use in conjunction with
zfs send/recv over a slow (<= 1Gbps) network link.

Example use, sender:
zfs send zfs/havoc@snap1 | comp | mbuffer -O titan:1234

Example use, receiver:
mbuffer -I 1234 | decomp | zfs recv rpool/havoc
