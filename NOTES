Stream format is *very* simple.

Consists of 0 or more blocks, each with the following format:

byte
0: format of following data
    FLAG_UNCOMPRESSED (0x0)
    FLAG_LZJB (0x1)
1-n: block of data in above format
   where n <= COMPBLOCK (currently 16384)

On the decompression side, you'll know how long a compressed block
was based on the extra value returned by the LZJB decompress function

Some tests:

./comp <debug | nc titan 1234
nc -l -p 1234 | ./decomp >debug

NEXT STEPS
----------
Add logic to determine OS in Makefile so that we can build on Linux
lz4 support
Optimize

FUTURE
------
Multi-thread so that reading & writing overlap

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
If you haven't got a Solaris box handy, I've found the easiest way to test
is via the Vagrant box "omniti/omnios-r151008".  For some of my testing, I
upgraded to the r151010 release via the instructions at 
http://omnios.omniti.com/wiki.php/Upgrade_r151008_r151010.  This may be
necessary in order to install the "mbuffer" package and is certainly 
needed if you require the "netcat" package.

You'll also need the following packages (via "pkg install")
gcc48
system/header
pkg://omnios/developer/versioning/git

You may additionally want packages for "netcat" and "mbuffer"

Don't forget to add /opt/gcc-4.8.1/bin to your PATH, perhaps in vagrant's
.bash_profile.
