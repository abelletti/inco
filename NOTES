Stream format is *very* simple.

Consists of 0 or more blocks, each with the following format:

byte
0: format of following data
    FLAG_UNCOMPRESSED (0x0)
    FLAG_LZJB (0x1)
1-n: block of data in above format
   where n <= COMPBLOCK (currently 16384)

On the decompression side, you'll know how long a compressed block
was based on the extra value returned by the LZJB decompress function

Some tests:

./comp <debug | nc titan 1234
nc -l -p 1234 | ./decomp >debug

NEXT STEPS
----------
Add logic to determine OS in Makefile so that we can build on Linux
Combine comp & decomp into inco, determine function based on name
lz4 support
make debugging a runtime option
implement with getopt
Optimize

FUTURE
------
Multi-thread so that reading & writing overlap
